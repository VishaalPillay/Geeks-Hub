# Getting Started with Next.js 15

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications by providing a powerful, production-ready framework right out of the box. With the release of Next.js 15, developers now have access to even more powerful features and improvements.

## Why Choose Next.js?

Next.js offers several compelling advantages for modern web development:

### 1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR)
SSR improves SEO and initial page load performance by rendering pages on the server before sending them to the client.

### 2. Static Site Generation (SSG)
Generate static HTML at build time for optimal performance and CDN caching.

### 3. API Routes
Build full-stack applications with built-in API routes that run on the same server.

## Setting Up Your First Project

Getting started with Next.js is straightforward. Here's how to create your first project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-awesome-app
cd my-awesome-app
npm run dev
```

This will scaffold a new Next.js application with all the necessary dependencies and configuration.

## Project Structure

Understanding the project structure is crucial for effective development:

```
my-awesome-app/
├── app/              # App Router (Next.js 13+)
├── public/           # Static files
├── components/       # React components
├── styles/           # CSS files
└── package.json      # Dependencies
```

## Key Concepts to Master

### App Router
The App Router, introduced in Next.js 13 and refined in version 15, provides:
- Nested layouts
- Server Components by default
- Simplified data fetching
- Built-in loading and error states

### Server Components
React Server Components reduce the JavaScript bundle size by rendering components on the server:

```jsx
// This component runs on the server
async function BlogPost({ id }) {
  const post = await fetchPost(id);
  return <article>{post.content}</article>;
}
```

### Client Components
For interactive features, use Client Components with the 'use client' directive:

```jsx
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>{count}</button>;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Server Components by default** - Only use Client Components when you need interactivity
2. **Optimize images** - Use the `next/image` component for automatic optimization
3. **Implement proper error boundaries** - Handle errors gracefully with error.tsx files
4. **Leverage ISR** - Use Incremental Static Regeneration for dynamic content
5. **Monitor performance** - Use Next.js built-in analytics and Web Vitals

## Advanced Features

### Middleware
Middleware allows you to run code before a request is completed:

```javascript
export function middleware(request) {
  // Add custom headers, redirect, rewrite, etc.
  return NextResponse.next();
}
```

### Parallel Routes
Display multiple pages in the same layout simultaneously:

```
app/
├── @team/
│   └── page.tsx
├── @analytics/
│   └── page.tsx
└── layout.tsx
```

## Performance Optimization Tips

- Enable automatic static optimization
- Use dynamic imports for code splitting
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Optimize your bundle size with tree shaking
- Use the built-in Font Optimization

## Deployment

Deploy your Next.js application with ease:

### Vercel (Recommended)
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel
```

### Self-hosting
```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 15 provides everything you need to build modern, performant web applications. With its powerful features like Server Components, App Router, and built-in optimizations, you can focus on building great user experiences while Next.js handles the complexity.

Start building with Next.js today and join the thousands of developers who have already made it their framework of choice for React applications.
